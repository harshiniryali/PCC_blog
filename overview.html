                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>As we are in the digital era, security is of paramount importance due to several factors:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pervasive Connectivity</li>
                    <li>Data Proliferation</li>
                    <li>Rapid Technological Advancements</li>
                    <li>Globalization and Remote Work</li>
                    <li>Cybercrime and Threat Landscape</li>
                    <li>Regulatory Compliance and Data Privacy</li>
                    <li>Trust and Reputation</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Security is vital to mitigate cybersecurity risks, protect sensitive data, 
                comply with regulations, maintain trust and reputation, and ensure the resilience of digital infrastructure
                and services. Organizations must adopt a proactive and holistic approach to cybersecurity 
                to address the evolving threats and challenges of the digital landscape effectively.</p>

    <h1>Steganography</h1>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Steganography is the practice of concealing secret information within an ordinary, non-secret file or
        message in order to avoid detection. Unlike cryptography, which focuses on securing the contents of a
        message, steganography aims to hide the existence of the message itself. The word "steganography" is
        derived from the Greek words "steganos"(covered) and "graphie"(writing).</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Steganography has a long history dating back to ancient times when secret messages were hidden in wax
            tablets or tattooed onto the shaven heads of messengers. During World War ll, invisible ink and microdots
            were used for covert communication.</p>

        <h3>Techniques</h3>
        <p>Common steganography techniques include -</p>
        <ol><li>Least Significant Bit(LSB) insertion : Altering the least significant bits of pixels in an image or audio
            file to encode hidden information.</li>
        <li>Spread Spectrum : Embedding data by slightly modifying the colour or amplitude of pixels or samples
            in digital media.</li>
        <li>Text-based steganography : Concealing messages within whitespace, formatting, or other non-printing characters in text documents.</li>
        <li>File-based steganography : Hiding data within the structure of files, such as adding extra space
            between letters in a document.</li></ol>

        <h3>Detection</h3>
        <p>Detecting steganography poses significant challenges due to the subtle nature of hidden data.
            Specialized steganalysis techniques, such as statistical analysis, anomaly detection, and visual inspection,are employed to detect the presence of hidden information in digital media.</p>
            <p>Overall, steganography is a powerful and evolving technique for covert communication and data hiding in
                the digital age, with implications for security, privacy, and forensic investigation.</p>

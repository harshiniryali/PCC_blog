    <h1>Dark Web</h1>
    <p>It refers to a part of the internet that is not indexed by traditional search engines and requires special software or configurations to access.
        It is often associated with illicit activities, including the buying and selling of drugs, weapons, stolen data,
        and other illegal goods and services. However, it also serves legitimate purposes, such as providing anonymity
        and privacy for whistleblowers, journalists, and activists in repressive regimes. </p>

    <p>Here are five browsing tools commonly used to access the dark web:</p>    
    <ol>
        <li>Tor browser</li>
        <li>I2p</li>
        <li>Freenet</li>
        <li>Whonix</li>
        <li>Subgraph OS</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It's important to note that while these tools can provide anonymity and privacy, they do not guarantee complete
         protection against all threats. Users should exercise caution and follow best practices for online safety when 
         accessing the dark web or engaging in sensitive activities online. Additionally, accessing illegal content or 
         engaging in illicit activities on the dark web may have legal consequences.</p>     
    <p>So, that's all I have to share with you all,</p>
